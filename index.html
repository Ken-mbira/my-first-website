        <h2><li><u>HTML</u></li></h2>
        <p>This is the standard markup language for Web pages. It contains a series of elements that tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
        <h3><i>History of HTML</i></h3>

            <h4 style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace">Element</h4>
            HTML elements are the defining items in a HTML document. They are characterised by opening and closing tags. The element itself is anything from the start to the end of the end tag. Most <br> elements need the closing end tags but there are a few that stand alone for example the line break element. Such elements are called <i>empty tags</i>

            <h3><i>HTML Documents</i></h3>
            HTML documents must start with the declaration (!DOCTYPE HTML). This must appear once at the top of the document and its purpose is to help the browser better display the document. When you're online and you wonder how the page developers accomplished a certain feature, you can do so by using the control (Ctrl+Shift+I)

        <h2><li><u>CSS</u></li></h2>
        <p>
            This stands for Cascading Sheets Styles. It has saved a lot of work since it can conrol the layout of multiple web pages at once.<br>With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!<br><u><mark>NB</mark></u>:<i> The word cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children elements within the parent.</i>
