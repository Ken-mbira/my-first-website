# My First Website
This is a simple web page that incorporates the basics of both HTML and CSS. It is developed in such a way that it gives a slight introduction to HTML and CSS. 
I thought that it is a good way to try out newly learnt tricks in the mentioned fields. 
## Names of contributors
Ken Mbira.
## Objectives
The main purpose of the webpage was to give me, the developer, a hands-on experience with HTML and CSS.
It is also meant to inspire future persons who might find in its simplicity, the point of view of a green developer trying to catch the programming language wave.
## Technologies used
1. HTML
2. CSS
## Future features
I intend to add more features such as:
- Background images
- Lsts 
- More links
